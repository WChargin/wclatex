wclatex
=======

This is my personal LaTeX repository.
Package files are of the form `wc<...>.sty`.

The main package that should be included is `wcsetup`.
By default, this loads `wcmath` and `wccmd`.
If the `listings` option is provided, it also loads `wclistings`.

See `wcsetup.sty` for more options.
